# Code Quiz

## Description

This is the forth weeks homework assignment. The requirements for this homework were to create a code quiz. When the start button was clicked, there should be a timer that starts, and be presented with a question. When that question is is answered there will be addtional questions until all the questions are answered. If a quesiton is answered incorrectly there will be a 10 second pentaly. When the game is over you can add your initials and post your score to the highscores list.

I also had the assistance of a tutor who really helped me navigate thorugh some issues I had and helped steer me in the right direction to complete this assignment. 

This project was a real challenge to me. I do feel I have completed all the requirements and have learned so much.
